# Poker Psych

Poker Psych is a real-time behavioral analysis tool for poker players and psychiatrists. Using a phone’s camera and microphone, it tracks cards, betting patterns, and player behavior during live poker sessions to build statistical and psychological profiles of both you and your opponents.

Players use Poker Psych to improve decision-making and risk taking, while psychiatrists gain insight into behavioral tendencies under pressure. The platform features an LLM-powered Poker Coach, voice-controlled betting, and adaptive poker bots that exploit player weaknesses based on collected game data, as well as custom designed Ace cards featuring our beloved Scotty Dog.

All analysis and agent coordination are powered by a Daedalus MCP server, with a computer vision model handling live card detection and tracking.
